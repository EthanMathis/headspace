# HeadSpace

HeadSpace is an app designed to help musicians & songwriters do what they love most. It is an environment for you to take all your song ideas, lyrics & chord structures and store them in one easily accessable hub. You can create, view, edit and remove songs from your personal collection. You can also take any song from your collection and allow friends to view or even edit & add to your creations. Once you log in head over to the 'Friends" tab where you can add friends, send and recieve private messages & even check out collections from anyone on your friends list. The interface for creating new songs is designed with musicians in mind. When you click on 'Create Song' you will be presented with a template to get you started. The idea is to give the user the option to write however they choose to.
